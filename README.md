## Abstract

Blended (or "hybrid") learning designates many different ways to
combine online and established classroom learning experiences. This
talk will concentrate on the *enriched virtual*
variant
[(Friesen, 2012)](http://learningspaces.org/papers/Defining_Blended_Learning_NF.pdf) in
which online learning is enriched periodically through face-to-face
activities. We will report on our experience moving from the usual
in-class teaching model to a blended model where asynchronous online
learning is interspersed with strong added-value classroom activities.
This approach received very positive feedback from many cohorts of
actuarial science students. For teachers and instructors interested in
converting their course to blended learning, we will provide our own
list of dos and don'ts.
