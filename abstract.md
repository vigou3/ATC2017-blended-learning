# TITLE

The Best of Both Worlds: Using Blended Learning in Actuarial Science Courses

# ABSTRACT

Blended (or "hybrid") learning designates many different ways to combine online and established classroom learning experiences. This talk will concentrate on the "enriched virtual" variant (Friesen, 2012) in which online learning is enriched periodically through face-to-face activities. We will report on our experience moving from the usual in-class teaching model to a blended model where asynchronous online learning is interspersed with strong added-value classroom activities. This approach received very positive feedback from many cohorts of actuarial science students. For teachers and instructors interested in converting their course to blended learning, we will provide our own list of dos and don'ts.


# Notes

## Bonne définition (Friesen, 2012)

Blended learning is the thoughtful fusion of face‐to‐face and online learning experiences. The basic principle is that face‐to‐face oral communication and online written communication are optimally integrated such that the strengths of each are blended into a unique learning experience congruent with the context and intended educational purpose.

- Organisation du cours (exemple Portail)
- Nécessaire: plateforme de distribution du contenu
- Forums: bof
- Quiz/évaluations formatives: bien
